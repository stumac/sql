**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Throughout my career, ethics have played a small significant part of my career. In truth, most of this was based
around PII and other privacy focused components. For instance, at one company I worked at, we dealt with a lot of
monitoring around network and hardware data. This industry niche is surprisingly important for many companies. If there's an
IT department somewhere, odds are they want some type of monitoring.

Naturally, there is a fine line to this type of data. Owners of the network (and hardware) usually have some
type of right to know how their networks are being used. That said, it's easy to go too far. It's not hard to
imagine a manager who wants to spy on their employees, and our software could provide that with sufficient
modifications. For instance, it was in fact possible to see banking data being sent by the user if they used
their own deviced on the employers network to access said bank.

The scariest part to me was when we had a feature request that effectively asked for just that. A potential
client wanted to view what a user was doing with their work laptops by sending useful metadata every few
minutes. In fact, if we enabled this type of feature, the configuration would allow the network owner to
view information from the user's private device _if_ they were attached to the company network. This usually
to me a hard line. A user using company hardware is usually something that has an expectation of no privacy, even
if it can be taken too far (and waste a lot of money for the company). But a users's private device is their own,
even if they're accidentally attached to the company network.

In the end, we opted to not allow such a feature. But it required a lot of "ticket bouncing" between the engineering
and sales teams. If I worked for a company that wasn't willing to stand against such a request, there was a very good
chance that I'd be looking for a new team, or a new job entirely.
